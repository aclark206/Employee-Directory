# Employee-Directory
Pulls employee data from a public api and formats it nicely into a directory

Creates a nicely formated employee directory with fake data pulled from https://randomuser.me/
It creates 12 employees with an image, name, email, and location.  If the user clicks on an employee, 
a Modal box pops up with more details about them employee.  

It has a search box so that the user may filter out the employees displayed by searching on the employee name.

The Modal box has previous and next buttons so that the user may scroll through the users without having to 
close the modal and click on each employee.  If the employees displayed are restricted by search criteria, the 
Modal scrolls though only the employees in the search results.
